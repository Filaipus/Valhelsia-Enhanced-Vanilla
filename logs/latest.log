[15:44:56] [ForkJoinPool-1-worker-2/WARN]: Mod registrate-fabric uses the version MC1.18.2-1.0.3 which isn't compatible with Loader's extended semantic version format (Could not parse version number component 'MC1'!), SemVer is recommended for reliably evaluating dependencies and prioritizing newer version
